# ChatApp Backend (Serverless with Cloudflare & Hono)

This repository contains the backend for a real-time chat application built with a serverless architecture using **Cloudflare Workers** and the **Hono framework**. The backend supports the creation of topic-based chat rooms (e.g., for food discussions), allowing users to communicate seamlessly in a globally distributed, low-latency environment.

## Features:
- **Serverless Architecture**: Powered by Cloudflare Workers, ensuring high availability, scalability, and cost efficiency.
- **Built with Hono**: A lightweight and fast web framework optimized for Cloudflare.
- **Real-time Communication**: Supports message broadcasting and user interactions in topic-specific rooms.
- **Global Distribution**: Leverages Cloudflare's edge network to reduce latency for users around the world.
- **Secure**: Implements user authentication and secure data handling.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales to handle increasing user demand without managing infrastructure.
- **Cloud-native storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval of messages and metadata for persistence.
